# Dotfiles

This repository contains my custom dotfiles for Zsh, including a custom `.zshrc` setup, Oh My Posh configuration, and support for `lsd` and Git aliases.

## Features
- Custom Zsh prompt using Oh My Posh with a blue gradient theme.
- Useful Git aliases for a more efficient workflow.
- Enhanced `ls` command using `lsd` with standard aliases (`ls`, `ll`, `la`, `lt`).
